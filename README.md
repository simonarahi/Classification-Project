# Arabic Handwritten Letter Recognition Project
This project is a final project for my Machine Learning class. In this project I build two different models to classify handwritten Arabic letters. 
The first model uses a Convolutional Neural Network to classify the 28 classes. This model reaches and accuracy of 95%. 
The second model used is a random forest classifier which does not perform as well and reaches 40% accuracy.

Previous work has been done on this matter, and this project has been inspired by several of them. Credits to two papers I used for reference:(1) A. El-Sawy, M. Loey, and H.
